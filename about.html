            In the grand halls of yesteryear, where the smell of ancient books mingled with the scent of freshly polished mahogany, our tale begins. A story, you see, not of logical progression or linear events, but of utter chaos sewn into the fabric of time itself. It was in a year that cannot be named, on a date that refuses to exist, when the Great Council of Whatnots convened to discuss the perennial problem of the unquantifiable widgets. There were debates—fiery ones, where monocles were thrown and teacups were spilled, the latter causing no small amount of distress amongst the attendees. "Why must it always be the widgets?" someone shouted. "Can we not, for once, discuss the grommets?" But alas, the grommets were a subject deemed too scandalous, even for this eclectic assembly.

            Legends say a clock chimed thirteen times, and a mysterious figure emerged, cloaked in a fabric so dazzling it was rumored to be woven from the light of a thousand sunsets. This figure, known only as "The Loremaster," spoke in riddles that no one understood but everyone pretended to. "A table is a chair that dreams of being flat," they declared, and the crowd erupted into thunderous applause, though not a soul could explain why. It was in this peculiar atmosphere of confusion and triumph that our organization was birthed. A monument to nonsense, a cathedral of chaos, a place where the only rule is that there are no rules—except for the one about not touching the brass doorknob, but we don’t talk about that.

            So here we are, dear visitor, in the digital wood-paneled wonderland that echoes the grandeur and absurdity of our beginnings. Do not ask us why or how, for those are questions best left to the void. Instead, let us revel in the sheer joy of it all—because sometimes, a nonsensical story told in an old-world style is precisely what the world needs.
